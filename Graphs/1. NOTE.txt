Implementation of "Shortest Path in weights" (Dijksta algo) is CORRECT.

There is problem in test cases when a vertex has more than one path to be reached WITH SAME WEIGHTS.

My code:-
        If vertex "v" has more than 1 path from source WITH SAME WEIGHTS, 
        print the path with LESSER number of edges.

Test Case Output:
        If vertex "v" has more than 1 path from source WITH SAME WEIGHTS, 
        Sometimes it prints path with MORE number of edges, sometimes with LESSER number of edges.
