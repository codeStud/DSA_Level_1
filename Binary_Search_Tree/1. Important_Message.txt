In the questions of Binary Search Tree -

The code to construct BST is same as that of construction of Binary Tree. 
The input is passed accordingly to make the output look like Binary Tree but it's not actually the construct function
of BST.



IN MY IMPLEMENTATIONS - 

I've kept the code to construct BST intact and correct (different from construct Binary Tree code)
So, the output BST generated is different.
But all the implemented SOLUTIONS of BST are CORRECT!!
